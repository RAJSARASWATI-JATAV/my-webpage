## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Build fails on deployment platform:
- Make sure Node.js version is 18 or higher
- Check if all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify build command is `npm run build`

### 404 errors on refresh:
- Make sure routing is configured (already done in config files)
- For Vercel: `vercel.json` handles this
- For Netlify: `netlify.toml` handles this
- For GitHub Pages: Workflow handles this
